# Refrigerator_Temperature_Controller_Circuit
Design a temperature control circuit for a refrigerator with 4 buttons, adjusting from 0 to 9 degrees Celsius. Temperature change follows the equation 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 = (3𝑥) ℃. Create a truth table, generate K-maps, derive equations, and design a logical circuit for precise temperature regulation.
