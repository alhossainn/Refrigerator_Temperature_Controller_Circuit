# Refrigerator_Temperature_Controller_Circuit
Designed a temperature control circuit for a refrigerator with 4 buttons, adjusting from 0 to 9 degrees Celsius. Temperature change follows the equation 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒 = (3𝑥) ℃. Create a truth table, generate K-maps, derive equations, and design a logical circuit for precise temperature regulation.

To implement the refrigerator temperature controller circuit, we initiate the project by constructing a truth table. Subsequently, seven K-maps are generated, yielding seven equations. Utilizing these equations, we design the logical circuit. The circuit is simulated using Quartus II software, encompassing vector generation, simulation waveforms, Verilog code, and simulation results. Additionally, hardware implementation details are illustrated. The project incorporates previous knowledge and extends learning to implement a seven-segment display.
